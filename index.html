                            <p class="abstract-summary"><strong>Abstract Summary:</strong> This study examines the impact of minority-owned business markers on online platforms. Using Yelp data and experiments, it finds that markers benefit some business categories, mainly when consumers are motivated to support minority-owned firms. For others, effects are inconsistent: markers may reinforce biases, shaping expectations about product quality based on owner ethnicity. In some cases, they even backfire, lowering preference for businesses outside stereotypical domains. Overall, markers help selectively and may unintentionally perpetuate bias.</p>
                            <p class="author-comment"><strong>Author's Comment:</strong> We explore the impact of online platforms' practice of highlighting minority-owned businesses with markers. Our findings suggest that these markers tend to benefit businesses primarily when consumers already champion the cause of minority empowerment. For consumers who are neutral or indifferent, the effect diminishes significantly. In some cases, if the business doesn't align with existing biases about minority ownership (i.e., operate outside the boundaries of existing stereotypes), these markers can actually backfire, reducing consumer interest. This raises important questions about the overall effectiveness of these markers and whether they inadvertently reinforce certain biases. Ultimately, our research highlights the need for platforms to consider these nuanced effects to ensure fairer outcomes for all businesses.</p>
